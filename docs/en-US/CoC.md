ConFLOSS' Organization doesn't tolerate any form of harassment or disrespect towards it's participants, being in the form of images, language or discriminatory behavior.

The practice of harassment includes offensive commentary - related to gender, special needs, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion and social/economical condition - images of sexual nature displayed in public spaces and/or at ConFLOSS' activities, intimidation, prosecution, harassment with cameras, repeated interruptions of speech and/or other occurrences, and physical contact without consent.

Participants who engage in behavior that infringes the rules of conduct of ConFLOSS will be warned and must immediately cease  the offensive behavior, under penalty of being asked to leave the event without reimbursement of the registration fee or possibility of returning. ConFLOSS' Organization will take the necessary actions to prevent  that harassment practices occur and/or be repeated at it's activities.

If you felt threatened or disrespected, contact the Organization and state your concerns and describe the incident . Members from the Organization may be located at the Event's Secretary, at the exhibition area.

The Organization will take the necessary actions to prevent the incident to repeat . We're part of and value the community and wish everyone an excellent event, independently of the differences that we all have that must not divide us in any way.
